# CS:300 Chat Application Project

This is a chat application I created for a project in my CS 300: Software Engineering course in Spring 2014. 

In the project, I use the following: 
  - Google Gson
  - Apache Derby JBDC
 
Please note that this application was for a class project and probably shouldn't be actually used since, for starters, it is insecure and stores passwords in plain text. 

Here are a few screen shots of the client.
